<h1>Upgrading From v2.4.2 to v3.0.0</h1>
The most important thing you need to know is, that iRPGUnit 3.* requires at least
IBM i 7.1. Older versions are no longer supported.
<p>
You need to update your RPGUNIT product library when upgrading the plug-in to 3.0.0, in
order to take advantage of all new features.
<p>
But it is not a show stopper when you updated the plug-in and afterwards notice that you
cannot update the library for whatever reasons. The plug-in can run with a 2.* library.
However some new features may not be available, such as the new XML stream file output.
<p>
All your existing unit test suites should run fine with iRPGUnit 3.0.0. However: 
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="notice"><b>Test your existing test suites carefully in a sandbox
                   environment, before upgrading to iRPGUnit 3.0.0.</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The following RPGUnit self-tests (compiled with v2.4.2) run fine with iRPGUnit: 
<ul>
<li>CMDRUNLOGT</li>
<li>CMDRUNT</li>
<li>CRTTSTT</li>
<li>EXTTSTT</li>
<li>LIBLT</li>
<li>PGMMSGT</li>
<li>STRINGT</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following RPGUnit self-tests (compiled with v2.4.2) do <b>not</b> run with iRPGUnit: 
<ul>
<li>Test case <i>testAssertWithFailure</i> of test suite ASSERTT, because of internal changes.</li>
<li>Test case <i>testGoodByeIsNotHello</i> of test suite ASSERTT, because of internal changes.</li>
<li>Test case <i>testTwoAndTwoIsNotEqualToFive</i> of test suite ASSERTT, because of internal changes.</li>
<p>
<li>Test suite <i>CALLPROCT</i>, because service program RURUNNER has been dropped.</li>
<li>Test suite <i>EXTPRCT</i>, because service program RURUNNER has been dropped.</li>
<li>Test suite <i>JOBLOGT</i>, because service program RURUNNER has been dropped.</li>
<li>Test suite <i>RUNT</i>, because service program RURUNNER has been dropped.</li>
<p>
<li>Test suite <i>RUACPTST</i>, because source file RPGUNITF1 has been renamed to QTESTCASES. Some
    test cases succeed, when QTESTCASES is duplicated to RPGUNITF1. Though some test cases will
    still fail, because of different statement numbers due to internal changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td class="important"><b>Existing test suites cannot be compiled with iRPGUnit 3.0, because
                        source member TESTCASE has been moved to source file QINCLUDE.</b>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Follow these steps to fix the problem:
<ol>
<li>Open the source member of an existing v2.x test suite.</li>
<li>Locate the <i>/copy</i> statement that includes source member <i>TESTCASE</i>.</li>
<li>Change that statement to include <i>TESTCASE</i> of source file QINCLUDE.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Example:</b>
<p>
<u>Before iRPGUnit 3.0:</u>
<code><pre class="indent">
/copy RPGUNIT1,TESTCASE
</pre></code> 
<u>With iRPGUnit 3.0:</u>
<code><pre class="indent">
/copy QINCLUDE,TESTCASE
</pre></code> 
<p>
Another option to fix the problem is to duplicate member <i>TESTCASE</i> of source file <i>QINCLUDE</i>
to source file <i>RPGUNIT1</i>.
<p>
<code><pre class="indent">
CRTSRCPF FILE(RPGUNIT/RPGUNIT1) RCDLEN(112)
CPYF FROMFILE(RPGUNIT2/RPGUNIT1) TOFILE(RPGUNIT/RPGUNIT1) FROMMBR(TESTCASE) TOMBR(*FROMMBR) MBROPT(*ADD)
</pre></code> 
<p>
For a period of transition iRPGUnit is shipped with a duplicate of member TESTCASE in file RPGUNIT1.
