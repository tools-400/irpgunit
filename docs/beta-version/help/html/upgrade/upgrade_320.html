<h1>Upgrading From v3.2.0 to v4.0.0</h1>
This version has been changed to support Cobol unit tests. Please notice that:
<p>
<ul>
<li>... there is a new RUCRTCBL command.</li>
<li>... there is a new RUCRTRPG command.</li>
<li>... there is still the old RUCRTTST command, which is a copy of RUCRTRPG.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following RPGUnit self-tests have been changed, because all commands
created by iRPGUnit are formatted, now. That change was necessary to ease
testing iRPGUnit: 
<ul>
<li>CRTTSTT</li>
</ul>
