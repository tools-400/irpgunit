The iRPGUnit plug-in connects the <i>IBM Rational Developer for i</i> with the RPGUnit library, that 
was started by Lacton back in September 2006. It adds a context menu item to the Remote Systems 
Explorer to let you run your RPGUnit test suites directly from there.
<p>
The plug-in bases on source code originally developed by Mihael Schmidt 
for his <a href="http://rpgnextgen.com/">RPG Next Gen<a> editor. It fixes a few bugs 
and adds many enhancements, such as a report viewer and the presentation
of the call stack information in the <i>RPGUnit</i> view.
<p>
Furthermore there is an extension for integrating the <i>iSphere</i> plug-in. It is recommended
to install the <i>iRPGUnit iSphere Integration Feature</i> for more convenience.
<p>
The RPGUnit library is an enhanced version of the library developed by <i>Laction</i> and 
continued by <i>Cyril Clemenceau</i> at <a href="http://rpgunit.sourceforge.net/">RPGUnit at SourceForge</a>. 
Unfortunately it looks like the project is no longer active. Nevertheless this website 
still a good place to get information about using RPGUnit.
<p>
After starting the project with RPG, version 4 now also
supports <a href="../quickstart/cobol/usage_cobol.html">Cobol</a>.

  <td class="important">It is important to know that starting with v3.0.0 source member TESTCASE has
                        been moved from source file RPGUNIT1 to source file QINCLUDE. Currently iRPGUnit
                        is shipped with a proxy member in file RPGUNIT1 to ensure backward compatibility
                        at compile time. This proxy member will be removed after 31.12.2019 with a later
                        version of iRPGUnit.<p>
