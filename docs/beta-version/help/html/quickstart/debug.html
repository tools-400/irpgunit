<h1>Debugging Test Cases</h1>
Debugging test cases is not as simple as debugging a standard RPG program from the 
command line, because you do not know the job, which runs the test case. It could 
be any QZRCSRVS job of the System i. Therefore you cannot start a service job and 
hence you cannot start the debugger.
<p>
The solution for that problem is using "Service Entry Points" (SEPs).  SEPs let you debug 
a batch program without knowing the job. Even the user profile may be unknown.
<p>
In order to set a SEP, you must right click on the service program that is your 
iRPGUnit test suite and select "Debug (Service Entry)" to set a service entry point.

Then make sure, that the iRPGUnit plug-in is in debug mode:

</p>
Debug mode is enabled, when the little green bug at the top right corner of the iRPGUnit view is pressed.
<p>
<u><b>Note:</b></u> When debug mode is disabled, the RDi freezes, when the program reaches the SEP!<p>
Now run your test case as usual. When the program reaches the SEP, you get a message 
that you need to answer with "Yes" in order to start a debug session:

</p>
Afterwards you can set your breakpoints and debug the unit test.
