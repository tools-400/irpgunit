<h1>Error: Could not update library</h1>
<p>
<h2>Symptom</h1>
<p>
The following error may be displayed, when uploading the iRPGUnit library:
<p class="indent">
<img class="noborder" src="./assets/updlib_error.png">
<p>
<h2>Reason</h1>
<p>
One or more objects could not be updated after the iRPGUnit library has been uploaded to the host.
<p>
The problem is, that the iRPGUnit programs that bind to service program RUTESTCASE do not search the
library list for the first match, but are hard-coded to RUTESTCASE in library RPGUNIT. Hence when library
RPGUNIT is uploaded using a different name, service program RUTESTCASE cannot be found.
<p>
In order to solve that problem, iRPGUnit attempts to re-bind the programs after the library was
uploaded.
<p>
<h2>Solution</h1>
<p>
Go to a CL command line and add your iRPGUnit library to the library list. Then execute
command UPDLIB to update the iRPGUnit objects:
<p class="indent">
<code class="code">UPDLIB LIB(irpgunit-library)</code></p>
<p>
Check the job log for errors. If you cannot solve the problem, try to compile the iRPGUnit
library by hand as explained on page <a href="../installation/installation.html#compiling_the_library">Installation</a>.
