<h1>Introduction</h1>
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/irpgunit/" target="_blank">
<img src="assets/iRPGUnit.png" style="float:right; margin-right:20px;  margin-bottom:20px" border=0></a>The RPGUnit plug-in connects the IBM Rational Developer for i with the 
RPGUnit utility, that was started by Lacton back in September 2006. It adds a context menue 
item to the Remote Systems Explorer to let you run your RPGUnit test suites directly
from the explorer.
<p>
The plug-in bases on source code originally developed by Mihael Schmidt 
at <a href="http://rpgnextgen.com/">RPG Next Gen<a>. It fixes a few bugs 
and adds some improvements, such as the report viewer and call stack information.
<p>
The RPGUnit library is an enhanced version of the RPGUnit plug-in developed by Laction and 
continued by Cyril Clemenceau at <a href="http://rpgunit.sourceforge.net/">RPGUnit at SourceForge</a>. 
Unfortunately it seems as if the project is no longer alive. Nevertheless the original
Internet pages at SourceForge are still a good source of information.
