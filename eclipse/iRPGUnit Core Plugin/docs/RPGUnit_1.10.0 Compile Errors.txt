Errors with 1.10.0
------------------

ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure
   Expected '9800', but was '16800'.
   Reason: Refactoring of module ASSERT. Introduced new procedure doAssert().

ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess
   Expected '', but was '
   Reason: The new "assertFailEvt" (assertFailEvtLong_t) had to be mapped to the
           old "assertFailEvt" (assertFailEvt_t) structure, which properly sets
           the length bytes of "assertFailEvt_v1.msg" to x'0000'. These bytes
           had been set to x'4040' before. Procedure ASSERT.clrAssertFailEvt()
           now uses 'clear' instead of '*BLANKS' to initialize the assert fail
           event structure.
